             My interests span from the scientific to the creative. Originally enrolled at the Community College of Allegheny County, (CCAC) for the undergraduate program for Psychology. I then moved into Software Development.<p>My inclination for psychology was always driven by my intuition and personal experience with mental health. I appreciate the scientific method as a framework to study the human brain and behaviors, and psychology is still a deeply nestled affinity. The creative side however was another important aspect that clawed its way forward and directed my sails into this new domain, notably apps. I had a catalyst for diving into Intro to Programming through my own mobile app idea. I held onto it for years and never thought I was the ‘type’ for programming, coding or engineering. With support from a dear friend, and some self determination, I took on the challenge to learn to code. I self-taught Java as my first language. I slowly came around to these novel and abstract concepts. I then enrolled in two Java courses at my college, which expanded into Web Development, Databases, Networking and an Android Mobile App course. I graduated with two AA (Associate of the Arts) degrees along with a certificate in Software Development. A participating member of my college Computer Club where I became more affluent with the culture of other software dev students and faculty. Learning, assisting and socializing with those in the space. I then branched out into local communities in Pittsburgh to network and continue in the presence of like minded people who share a career or interest for software, design or engineering. I was an attendee of Code and Coffee Pittsburgh and a regular attendee at Code and Supply in Pittsburgh.

            <p>3D design is one of my passions. My background in
              home remodeling, carpentry and woodworking fostered an appreciation for architectural
              aspects, furniture and sculpture. Below is how a concept might go from a pencil drawing to Sketchup model to 3D rendered image.
