            <span><strong>Robert “Kody” Dell’Aquila</strong></span> 
            <br>
            I go by RJ or Kody, or even sometimes Robert. One time I was even called “Bob”.
            <p>
             My interests have spanned from the scientific to the creative. Originally I was enrolled at the Community College of Allegheny County, (CCAC) for the undergraduate program for Psychology. Along the way I changed course into Software Development. Going from humans, and specifically the human brain to computers and technology was quite a leap across a few Venn diagrams to say the least. <p>My inclination for psychology was always driven by my intuition and personal experience with mental health. I appreciate the scientific method as a framework to study the human brain and behaviors, and psychology is still a deeply nestled affinity. The creative side however was another important aspect that clawed its way forward and directed my sails into this new domain, ntyoably app making. I had a catalyst for diving into Intro to Programming through my own mobile app idea. I held onto it for years and never thought I was the ‘type’ for programming, coding or engineering. With support from a dear friend, and some self talk, I took on the challenge within to challenge that inner voice of doubt. I self-taught Java as my first language. Starting with the Head First series book I slowly came around to these novel and abstract concepts. I then enrolled in two Java courses at my college, which expanded into Web Development, Databases, Networking and an Android Mobile App course. I managed to graduate with two AA (Associate of the Arts) degrees along with a certificate in Software Development. I’ve been a member of my local college’s Computer Club where I became more affluent with the culture of other software dev students and faculty. Learning, assisting and socializing with those in the space. I then branched out into some local communities in Pittsburgh to network and continue being in the presence of like minded people who share a career, interest or love for software, design or engineering. I was an attendee of Code and Coffee Pittsburgh and regular attendee at Code and Supply in Pittsburgh.

            This is my landing page that I hand-coded with vanilla HTML, CSS and some Javascript.

            My portfolio will showcase my other skillsets of 3D Modeling along with my software development contributions and UI/UX skills.

            <h2 id="3d-section">3D Modeling</h2>
            <p>3D design is a passion. My go for quick design is Sketchup. My background in
              home remodeling, carpentry and woodworking fostered appreciation for architectural
              aspects of buildings,furniture and even sculpture. Below is how a concept might go from a Sketchup model to 3D rendered image (from another software).
              The final render was done with Twilight. Most of my renders are done in Twilight
              but other's used are Enscape.
